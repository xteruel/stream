The STREAM benchmark
====================

The STREAM benchmark is a simple synthetic benchmark program that measures
sustainable memory bandwidth (in MB/s) and the corresponding computation rate
for simple vector kernels. 

STREAM was created and is maintained by John McCalpin. The STREAM benchmark was
developed while McCalpin was on the faculty at the University of Delaware.
After three years at SGI, six years at IBM, and three years at AMD, McCalpin
becomes employee of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of
Texas at Austin, working on performance analysis of applications on TACC's
major systems, and on technology issues related to advanced and novel computing
architectures.

The STREAM benchmark remains an independent academic project, which will not be
influenced or directed by commercial concerns. In order to maintain this
independence, the STREAM benchmark is hosted at the University of Virginia:

Papers citing the STREAM Benchmark in general should refer to:

McCalpin, John D., 1995: "Memory Bandwidth and Machine Balance in Current High
Performance Computers", IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Computer
Architecture (TCCA) Newsletter, December 1995.

Papers citing specific STREAM benchmark results that are published at this site
should (also) include a reference such as:
